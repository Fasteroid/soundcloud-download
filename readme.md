This is a simple extension that adds a download button to Soundcloud pages.

#### Features:
- Download individual tracks (track page)
- Download all of a user's tracks (user page)
- Download all tracks in a playlist (playlist page)
- Adds metadata such as song title and cover art

Sometimes you may need to refresh the page in order for the button to show up.
